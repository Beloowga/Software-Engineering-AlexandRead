# Software-Engineering-AlexandRead

## Overview

This project aims at creating an online library system experience called **AlexandRead**.
The goal of the project is to regroup open-source references all in one place.
We aim to make the references easily accessible so that readers can save their favorites and give feedback on them (ratings and comments).
The platform is available on desktop web-browsing.
